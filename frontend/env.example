# ============================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ============================================
# Copy this file to .env and replace with production URL
# DO NOT commit .env file to version control

# Backend API URL
# Development: http://localhost:8000
# Production: https://api.yourcompany.com (replace with actual URL)
# 
# ⚠️ CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION:
# - MUST use HTTPS (not HTTP) when frontend is served over HTTPS
# - Mixed content (HTTPS page → HTTP API) will be blocked by browsers
# - Do NOT include trailing slash (/) at the end
#
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Example for production (HTTPS required):
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.hronboarding.sumerudigital.com
#
# ❌ WRONG (will cause mixed content error):
# VITE_API_URL=http://api.hronboarding.sumerudigital.com
